      <description>Another Friday evening. I jump on my bike and feel a smile on my face. Hello, Berlin. You are gray, cold and wet today, but I feel warm inside and excited about the days ahead of me.

      <description>My motivation for writing this post The topics I&amp;rsquo;ve always been most enthusiastic about are human connections and everything connected to how we navigate through life. Recently, the conversations I&amp;rsquo;ve been having brought similar questions to the surface. Many are wondering:
 Why am I feeling tired and sluggish most of the days? How can I feel less stressed and more at ease? How can I resolve conflicts with people I am working with?</description>
