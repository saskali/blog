      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been two weeks now since Heart of Clojure. Time for reflections. ðŸŒŸ
I feel much movement within, a sense of wonder, a pinch of surprise and a big portion of gratitude. It was a special conference for me.
The Background Story A while ago, I made a promise to myself. I decided to accept every possibility to speak in front of people. In the past, having all attention on me was one of the most frightening moments.</description>

      <description>I have learned to listen closely to my mind. How am I talking to myself? What thoughts are crossing my mind at any moment? What are the underlying believes that shape how I live my life?
I know that things can change faster than we believe is possible. Focus and determination can go a long way. I shift the way I think, so does my reality. I hear the voice of a dear friend of mine:</description>

      <description>Another Friday evening. I jump on my bike and feel a smile on my face. Hello, Berlin. You are gray, cold and wet today, but I feel warm inside and excited about the days ahead of me.
About half a year ago, I kept hearing about something that is called Movement Medicine. I had no idea what is was, but my intuition took me right into a space of freedom, connection and acceptance.</description>

      <description>My motivation for writing this post The topics I&amp;rsquo;ve always been most enthusiastic about are human connections and everything connected to how we navigate through life. Recently, the conversations I&amp;rsquo;ve been having brought similar questions to the surface. Many are wondering:
 Why am I feeling tired and sluggish most of the days? How can I feel less stressed and more at ease? How can I resolve conflicts with people I am working with?</description>

      <description>Minimal tig keybindings to make the most out of your commit flow. It was at my first programming internship that one of my collegues showed me how to use tig. It is a text-mode interface that offers a more interactive and flexibel way of developing compared to using git with the command line only. I have been using it ever since and I feel more productive and in control of my commit flow.</description>
